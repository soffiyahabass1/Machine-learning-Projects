Polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS is a common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. In my latest project, I create a model that can predict PCOS diagnoses. 
The dataset used has five features that are typically associated with the diagnosis and risk factors of PCOS.
I conducted exploratory analyses, several visualization to uncover relationships within the data. A non linear SVM (support vector machine) model with polynomial features was used to predict PCOS diagnosis with an accuracy of 97%, recall score93%, precision score 97%,F1 score 96%
Future work could be to increase the recall score since we need to detect all PCOS cases.
