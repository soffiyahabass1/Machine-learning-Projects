# Lung Cancer Classification Using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying lung CT scan images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Lung Cancer Images]
- The dataset contains labeled images of lungs, divided into two categories:
  - Cancerous
  - Non-Cancerous

##  Model Architecture

The custom CNN was built using PyTorch and consists of:

- Multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization and ELU activations
- Depthwise convolution to reduce parameters
- Average pooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Softmax for final classification

> The model is dynamically defined to determine the flattened shape before the fully connected layer is applied.

##  Training

- Optimizer: `NAdam`
- Loss Function: `CrossEntropyLoss`
- Epochs: 15
- Learning Rate: `1e-5`
- Evaluation using separate test dataset

##  Performance Metrics

| Metric      | Value    |
|-------------|----------|
| **Accuracy**| 93.03%   |
| **Precision** | 92.32% |
| **Recall**    | 93.03% |
| **F1-Score**  | 92.65% |
